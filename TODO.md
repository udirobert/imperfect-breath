# Project TODO ‚Äì Camera Stream Architecture Refactor

## Completed (‚úîÔ∏è)
- [x] Analyze current video feed and session architecture.
- [x] Centralize camera stream ownership in `CameraContext`.
- [x] Remove duplicate stream handling in `SessionPreview`.
- [x] Add stream attachment effect in `VideoFeed`.
- [x] Update `VideoFeed` to use `hasVideoStream` from context.
- [x] Ensure DRY, clean, modular code per Core Principles.

## Remaining (üü°)
- [ ] Verify that `useSession` no longer manually attaches the stream (already uses `CameraContext`).
- [ ] Remove any leftover `requestCamera` calls in other components if present.
- [ ] Run the development server (`npm run dev`) and test the video feed across all session phases.
- [ ] Add unit tests for `VideoFeed` to confirm it renders when `hasVideoStream` is true.
- [ ] Update documentation (`docs/TECHNICAL_GUIDE.md`) with the new stream flow diagram.
- [ ] Perform a final code lint/format pass and commit changes.

## Notes
- The architecture now follows **Enhancement First**, **Aggressive Consolidation**, **DRY**, **Clean Separation**, **Modular**, **Performant**, and **Organized** principles.
- All stream handling is centralized in `CameraContext`; UI components only consume the stream state.
