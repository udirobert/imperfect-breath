# RevenueCat Secure Setup Guide

> **üîí SECURITY FIRST**: This guide follows secure practices to protect your API keys and user data

## üìã Prerequisites

- [x] RevenueCat account created
- [x] API key generated: ...
- [x] Minimal permissions configured (read-only for customers, subscriptions, offerings)

## üîê Step 1: Secure API Key Configuration

### **Local Development Setup**

1. **Update your local environment file**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env.local (already created)
   nano .env.local
   ```

2. **Replace the placeholder with your actual key**:
   ```env
   # Replace this line:
   VITE_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY=goog_YOUR_ANDROID_KEY_HERE

   # With your actual key:
   VITE_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY= ....
   ```

3. **Verify security**:
   ```bash
   # Confirm .env.local is NOT tracked by git
   git status
   # Should NOT show .env.local in untracked files
   ```

### **Production Deployment Setup**

For production deployment (Google Play release):

1. **Netlify/Vercel Environment Variables**:
   - Add `VITE_REVENUECAT_ANDROID_KEY= ....
   - Keep as private/secret variable

2. **Android Build Variables**:
   - Will be bundled during build process
   - Key is only exposed in compiled app (secure)
