# Codebase Review: DRY, CLEAN, ORGANISED, MODULAR, PERFORMANT

## üîç **Current Issues Identified**

### **DRY Violations:**
1. **Duplicate Vision Hooks**: `useVision`, `useOptimizedVision`, `useIntegratedVisionFeedback` have overlapping functionality
2. **Redundant Components**: `EnhancedDualViewBreathingSession` and `AdvancedVisionBreathingSession` share 80% of code
3. **Repeated Patterns**: Camera setup, session management, and UI patterns duplicated across components
4. **Similar State Management**: Multiple hooks managing similar state (isActive, metrics, etc.)

### **CLEAN Code Issues:**
1. **Large Components**: `AdvancedVisionBreathingSession` is 400+ lines - violates single responsibility
2. **Mixed Concerns**: UI rendering, business logic, and state management in same components
3. **Complex Dependencies**: Too many hooks imported in single components
4. **Unclear Naming**: Some functions and variables could be more descriptive

### **ORGANISATION Problems:**
1. **Scattered Features**: Vision features spread across multiple directories
2. **Inconsistent Structure**: Some hooks in `/hooks`, some logic in `/lib/vision`
3. **Missing Abstractions**: No clear separation between core vision and advanced features
4. **Unclear Hierarchy**: Component relationships not well-defined

### **MODULAR Issues:**
1. **Tight Coupling**: Components directly importing multiple specific hooks
2. **Feature Interdependence**: Advanced features tightly coupled to specific implementations
3. **No Plugin Architecture**: Features can't be easily enabled/disabled
4. **Monolithic Hooks**: Large hooks doing multiple things instead of focused responsibilities

### **PERFORMANCE Concerns:**
1. **Multiple Vision Instances**: Different components may create multiple vision engines
2. **Redundant Processing**: Similar calculations happening in multiple places
3. **Memory Leaks**: Potential issues with multiple cleanup functions
4. **Bundle Size**: Adding features increases bundle size without tree-shaking

## üéØ **Refactoring Strategy**

### **1. Create Unified Vision Architecture**
- Single `VisionEngine` with plugin system
- Unified `useVision` hook with feature flags
- Centralized state management
- Plugin-based feature loading

### **2. Component Composition Pattern**
- Base `BreathingSession` component
- Feature-specific wrapper components
- Composable UI elements
- Render prop patterns for flexibility

### **3. Feature Plugin System**
- `BreathPatternPlugin`
- `PostureAnalysisPlugin` 
- `MobileOptimizationPlugin`
- `PerformanceMonitorPlugin`

### **4. Centralized State Management**
- Single session state store
- Feature-specific state slices
- Unified action dispatchers
- Optimized re-renders

### **5. Performance Optimizations**
- Lazy loading of features
- Tree-shakable exports
- Memoized computations
- Efficient re-renders
